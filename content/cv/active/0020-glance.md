Assisted the Glance DevOps team with the automation of building, deploying, and scaling of Glance server instances on AWS and Azure.

The legacy deployment strategy relied on hand-run shell scripts and manual version rollouts across multiple AWS regions. Packer was introduced into the build process, resulting in one-click builds of server images.

I worked with the Glance development team to create a RESTful API interface into their infrastructure, then used that API to build out autoscaling logic to automatically scale Glance server instances to meet load.
